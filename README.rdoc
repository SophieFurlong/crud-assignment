Played around with the CSS and the HTML.

Added a Bootstrap.

Made links and Nav bar clickable. 

created two objects.

You can CRUD each object.

The objects have a belongs_to and has_many_relationship.

(I had many issues including changing the default homepage. After careful reasearch it still would crash my server after I tried changing it. I also have a lot of issues with the tests and would like some one on one help with it at some point.)
